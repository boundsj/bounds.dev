That it&rsquo;s caused much distress and so fearness.

Instead they nap and clean their fur-ness.]]></description>

Pressured their base on abortion, the Republicans strain,
Though most wished to display no disdain.
Supreme Court justices,
Their ruling may miss us,
While South Korea&rsquo;s enraged by the gain.
Leaked Pentagon papers aplenty,
Spying accusations they sent to the penny.
Ukraine&rsquo;s war won by lights,
To EV goals new heights,
And children separated, could any be more shabby?]]></description>

Donald Trump pleaded with &lsquo;not guilty&rsquo; plight
He claimed it was for his honour and pride,
But the evidence stacked up, in quite a big lump,
He was left feeling, confused and denied.
The Times analysed the indictment all sealed,
The details we soon, then revealed
But all of the fuss,
Was really because
Of the woman, hush money, Stormy Daniels appealed.]]></description>
