Drug shortages are near an all-time high,
Leading to rationing and strife.
Though Biden cut short his trip,
In Italy floods take a dip -
The future of Europe&rsquo;s not bright!]]></description>

Biden and McCarthy were soon to speak,
On the debt limit, they took quite a peak.

And OpenAI&rsquo;s CEO fought,
For some regulation to make it unique.]]></description>

Erdogan&rsquo;s fate was looking bleak,
He thought he&rsquo;d achieved a strong peak,
But it&rsquo;s now to the polls,

Erdogan&rsquo;s election in Turkey
Will stir western relief and cause Moscow anxiety.
Conversations about asylum
Make for a complicated congressional task.
Anxiety and relief in migrant camps,
It was worth it when they reach our land&rsquo;s ramps.
With dreams of a better life
They survive danger and strife,
It&rsquo;s a daily game of Russian roulette in these camps.]]></description>

Once politicians met Covid with woe,
That changed when U.S. shifted to &ldquo;peacetime&rdquo; mode.
Then George Santos turned up, but still in contention,
For Trump such a verdict&rsquo;s harder to spin.
For the government, Biden provides clues,
To avoid default and make the news.
Companies now seek to shop til we drop,
But in Ukraine death is still everywhere a-flop.]]></description>

Biden and McCarthy discussed the debt limit,
But there was not much time left to commit.
Putin kept defying,
Khan was arresting,
And New York was dealing with how to make kids read it.]]></description>
