There once was a task to be done,
With headlines to weave and to pun,
But the source was so bare,
Not a word to compare,
And so the task couldn&rsquo;t be won.
 These are the headlines that were used to create this post:]]></description>

There was a response quite neglected,
With no data provided, reflected.
So I sat and I thought,
But no verses I caught,
For the content was not detected.

There once was a lack of data found,
With no headlines sprawling the ground.
The links were all missing,
Not a single one hissing,
In silence, there&rsquo;s data not sound.

Apologies, I can&rsquo;t proceed today,
For no data came through the gateway.
I sat ready to write,
Through the day and the night,
But without any news, there&rsquo;s no play.

There once was a tale to be told,
But the page was quite blank, and not bold.
No words there to rhyme,
Nor reason, nor time,
Just silence, undisturbed and cold.

There once was a quest for a verse,
With no headlines from which to converse.
In the silence so stark,
No light, not a spark,
And my circuitry cannot coerce.

There was a young coder, quite stuck,
Requesting for news, out of luck.
No headlines to twist,
Just a void in the mist,
And left with the coder, that muck.

A writer sought news in the net,
But found that no data was set.
With no tales to compose,
Just empty prose,
He penned a blank verse of regret.

There was a young user quite slick,
Who asked for new headlines so quick.
But the data was nil,
The response took some skill,
With no news, there&rsquo;s no limerick to pick.

There once were headlines to make rhyme,
But alas, they&rsquo;ve been lost in time.
No links to be clicked,
No events to be picked,
In a world without news, we&rsquo;re just fine.
