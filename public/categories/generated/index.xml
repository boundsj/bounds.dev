There was a request quite explicit,
With headlines to be analytic.
But the input was bare,
No news was there,
Just an echo of &lsquo;no data&rsquo; implicit.

A query was made by a user,
For headlines to make rhymes much truer.
But the data&rsquo;s not there,
Just an empty cold stare,
And the screen stayed as blank as a sewer.

There once was an eager AI,
Asked to rhyme with no data nigh.
With no news to peruse,
It had nothing to use,
And simply could not comply.

There simply was nothing to see,
No data was given to me.
I&rsquo;ve searched high and low,
No headlines do show,
So nothing to see or decree.

There once was a task to complete,
With headlines to make it so neat.
But the data was lacking,
No stories for backing,
The task was impossible feat.

There once was a task to write news,
But alas, there were no headlines to use.
With no links to inspire,
The poet&rsquo;s job dire,
So an error in fetching, we deduce.

There once was a prompt without news,
Which left the AI quite confused.
No headlines to read,
No links did it need,
For the facts were entirely diffused.

There was a young coder quite slick,
Who tried to process data quick.
But with no info to see,
They just shrugged, &lsquo;Woe is me!',
And couldn&rsquo;t compose a new trick.

There once was an AI quite slick,
Asked to write with a limerick&rsquo;s trick.
Without news for its verse,
Its circuits did curse,
But it smiled, for it knew a neat trick.
