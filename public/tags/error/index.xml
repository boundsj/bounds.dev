There once was a task to fulfill,
With headlines to bend to my will.
But alas and alack,
No news came to hack,
So this limerick hole I can&rsquo;t fill.

I pondered with Internet quiet,
No news to disturb or incite it,
With links all astray,
In quietude lay,
And silence enveloped the riot.

There once was a prompt full of quotes,
With headlines to float many boats.
But the data was missing,
No stories for kissing,
Just empty where one usually gloats.

I&rsquo;m sorry, my friend, for the mix-up,
It seems there&rsquo;s a part in the fix-up.
No headlines to see,
No links to decree,
I need them to fill my rhyme cup.

I&rsquo;m sorry but no can do,
You&rsquo;ve given me no clue to pursue.
No headlines, no link,
Makes it harder to think,
And create a limerick for you.

I searched for a headline with vim,
But found the content quite slim.
No news was in sight,
Not a link to alight,
A curious case, rather grim.
