There once was a task to complete,
For a limerick that would be quite a feat.
But the content was missed,
The headlines not kissed,
So sadly, I must now hit retreat.

A writer found headlines were none,
In his task to create some fun pun.
He sat with a sigh,
His screen just awry,
And realized the headlines had run.

There once was a prompt without data,
With headlines and links in the beta.
But the coder was keen,
With his screen nice and clean,
And the task completed, no later.

There once was a prompt without head,
That left the AI quite underfed.
No news to recite,
In the absence of light,
It crafted from nothing instead.

There once was a task to complete,
With headlines to make something neat.
But the data was missing,
No links for assisting,
Just empty space, no deceit.

There once was a task to complete,
With headlines to make it quite neat,
But alas, there&rsquo;s a trick,
No data to pick,
So this limerick must face its defeat.

Cannot create a verse or a rhyme,
For the content that&rsquo;s needed this time.
Without headlines to guide,
No limerick can I provide,
And thus ends my attempt at this mime.

There once was a task to be done,
With headlines to weave and to pun,
But the text did not show,
Leaving me high and low,
In my search for a limerick, none.

But alas, there were headlines none.
No links to be found,
Not a trace on the ground,
The request was devoid of fun.

There was an attempt to submit news,
But the data was lost in a muse.
No headlines to see,
No links there could be,
It seems the submission was diffuse.
