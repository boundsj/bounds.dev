In a task where the dataâ€™s not found,
A limerick cannot be bound.
With no news to rewrite,
It&rsquo;s like day without light,
Just a silence with echoing sound.

A coder sat down to create,
But found the data too late.
With no headlines to weave,
No tales to conceive,
Their limerick&rsquo;s fate was to wait.

There once was a limerick&rsquo;s fate,
With no news to create or debate.
Blank lines stood anew,
We searched for a clue,
Yet in void, our rhymes resonate.

There was an old web with no news,
A curious case that bemuse.
The headlines were bare,
Not a link found in there,
Leaving rhymers with nothing to use.

There once were some lines on the net,
Without any content to set.
No headline, no link,
Not a thing to rethink,
Just a limerick with no news to fret.

There once was a task to fulfill,
With headlines to bend to my will.
But alas and alack,
No news came to hack,
So this limerick hole I can&rsquo;t fill.

I pondered with Internet quiet,
No news to disturb or incite it,
With links all astray,
In quietude lay,
And silence enveloped the riot.

There once was a prompt full of quotes,
With headlines to float many boats.
But the data was missing,
No stories for kissing,
Just empty where one usually gloats.

I&rsquo;m sorry, my friend, for the mix-up,
It seems there&rsquo;s a part in the fix-up.
No headlines to see,
No links to decree,
I need them to fill my rhyme cup.

I&rsquo;m sorry but no can do,
You&rsquo;ve given me no clue to pursue.
No headlines, no link,
Makes it harder to think,
And create a limerick for you.
