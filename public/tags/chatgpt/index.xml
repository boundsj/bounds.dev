Where migrants could feel secure and unhurried.
For safety and security they craved,
In this land of hope they were saved,
And found a new home that wasn&rsquo;t so harried.]]></description>

But a judge put his efforts to fail.

Trump&rsquo;s hold lost appeal,
So DeSantis took aim, no avail.]]></description>

Ukraine&rsquo;s fighters are primed for a fight,
China sends gunpowder with might.
Kakhovka saw a strike,
A year without Roe,
Where the clinics close one does not write.
Secret Navy sensors detected a heat,
The Titan that went to its defeat.

To Charleston for a journey of woe,
Far Right spins its tale to the street.]]></description>

For his family is the great Indian scene.]]></description>
