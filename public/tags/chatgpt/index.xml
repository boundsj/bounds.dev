In Ukraine where their claims sent &lsquo;em dive.

Until another ship had to take a different course!]]></description>

Their Wrecking Ball Polices Were Enough to Displease.
Ukraine Took a Big Challenge, Pledging Ammunitions In Store,
But Providing It, Was A Problem It Couldn&rsquo;t Ignore.]]></description>

Events of the day could seem quite confusin&rsquo;]]></description>
