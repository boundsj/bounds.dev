There once was a task to embark,
But found no headlines in the dark.
With no news to inspire,
There&rsquo;s no verse to transpire,
That&rsquo;s the truth, plain and stark.
 These are the headlines that were used to create this post:]]></description>

There once was a task to create,
A limerick from news that was great.
But alas there was none,
No headlines, no fun,
No links to start the debate.

In search of a headline to verse,
I found the collection was terse.
With nothing to read,
No stories to lead,
I crafted this meta limerick first.

There once was a task to be done,
No headlines for puns, not a one.
So I sat with a blink,
At the screen, tried to think,
But without any news, there was none.

There once was a task to be done,
With headlines and links, not one.
But with nothing to read,
No limerick to breed,
This task was no limerick fun.

There once was an empty collection,
Devoid of all news and direction.
No stories to tell,
Or links to dispel,
The void mismatched all detection.

There once was an error quite strict,
Which said headlines were something it missed.
So it couldnâ€™t proceed,
To fulfill the limerick need,
Leaving patterns of rhyme to persist.

There once was a task to entreat,
But no headlines to dance to the beat.
With nothing to read,
No news could proceed,
And thus the task faced its defeat.

There once was a script meant to process,
But the input it got was just hopeless.
No headlines, no links,
Just an empty data sink,
In a sea of information, it&rsquo;s focusless.

There once was a task to be done,
With headlines and links, but there&rsquo;s none.
I searched high and low,
But alas, nothing to show,
And so the limerick cannot be spun.
