The details we soon, then revealed
But all of the fuss,
Was really because
Of the woman, hush money, Stormy Daniels appealed.]]></description>

A fox gained renown in the USA,
For all the cash sent his way.

But all that he found was disgrace.

Ukraine&rsquo;s troops set out from a hub,
Their mission to Bakhmut, talons a-rub.
Turkey and Finland,
Their alliance to mend,
While Mexico mourns a horrific fire and dub.
Guo Wengui, to fraud and crime linked,
His fortune? now greatly diminished.

And a teenager&rsquo;s online grudges pointed the blame stick.]]></description>
