Republicans try to block blame,
Vulnerable to a shutdown game.
No one&rsquo;s gaining ground,
In Ukraine this year round,
Instead it&rsquo;s just fighting&rsquo;s same.
The debate on one night is seen,
Hope Trump won&rsquo;t pose a new regime.
Biden and Trump give a preview,
Who won? We can&rsquo;t even infer.
Silvery shimmer Beyonce did bring,
Corruption tight definition sting.]]></description>

EU Law sets a stage for a clash,
&lsquo;tween big tech and a gush.

who&rsquo;s standing on the stump,
trying to dispel disinformation with a hush!]]></description>

Biden went to the picket line to court his fate,
In Michigan where the autoworkers await.
Russia seeks to show their commander is alive,
In Ukraine where their claims sent &lsquo;em dive.

Peak oil is near but climate is still to quell.]]></description>

A Chinese ship had such force,
That it blocked off the South China Sea of course.
Blasting bullhorns and water cannons,
It caused quite a ruckus,
Until another ship had to take a different course!]]></description>

One Day on the Border, Eight Thousand Nine Hundred,
As More Migrants Were Arrested, Left Feeling Forsaken.
The Far Right&rsquo;s Alliance Brought Washington to its Knees,
Their Wrecking Ball Polices Were Enough to Displease.
Ukraine Took a Big Challenge, Pledging Ammunitions In Store,
But Providing It, Was A Problem It Couldn&rsquo;t Ignore.]]></description>

Who wanted to make others agree.

To follow and do as they should seen.]]></description>
