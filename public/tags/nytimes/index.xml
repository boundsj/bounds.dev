The monarchy persists, no matter how high
It&rsquo;s the same since old time,
As the story goes on to rhyme
But the answer remains still a surprise!]]></description>

Manipulated by a corruptor they&rsquo;d jet.

Was out of all sentiment,
It&rsquo;s no surprise it was such a big threat!]]></description>

As interest rates did its toll hold.
Inflation so high,
What&rsquo;s driving it? Why,
A different set of drivers we&rsquo;re told.
Fox&rsquo;s top execs, in a bind,
When a crisis, texts, came to find.
Airman accused,
Racist and violent remarks used,
These headlines are all intertwined.
