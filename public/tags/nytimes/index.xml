Who&rsquo;s stance left his rivals to squeal
His tightrope was fraught
Conflicts he had to sort
It&rsquo;s a puzzle no one can unravel]]></description>

China invested one trillion, to gain global influence then,
Putin came by to show, their powerful alliance grow,
In Europe Poland&rsquo;s rebelling, trying to weaken their spelling,
The U.S. sees chips they can&rsquo;t lend, China&rsquo;s tech advance they must fend.]]></description>

Tried to intervene,
But despair lead to transformation of the whole ouch!]]></description>

Tens of thousands of Gazans must flee
Some search for food, shelter, but where?
Israel&rsquo;s safe passage did decree
And Egypt also agreed to care
Americans could go, no fear
But all others must flee and seek clear]]></description>

Israelis rush with will and pride,
Despite Hamas&rsquo; missiles they bide.

Tensions on Israel&rsquo;s boarders start to climb,

Village by village, scale of atrocities clear,
Airstrikes pummel Gaza, Israelis and Palestinians near,
Israel&rsquo;s security services failed to stop the attack,
Iran news said no direct involvement, which they lacked,
In tiny, crowded Gaza, violent videos fill social feed,
Shockingly, Israel braces for invasion, indeed.]]></description>

An attack sparked fear and confusion,
From the Middle East to Jerusalem.
