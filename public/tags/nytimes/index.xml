There once was a town full of strife,
When wildfires scrambled their life.
It brought them such woe,
As kin they did know,
Saw homes they would never get to strife.]]></description>

In Ohio there seemed to be consternation,
For a GOP change was the sensation.
Voters denied the move,
For abortion to prove,
That it can shape election resultation.]]></description>

Don&rsquo;t be so picky about a job,
In China, that&rsquo;s a lesson they&rsquo;d sob.
What cuisine means to Taiwan
With China brings an issue so plain.
Two cultures clash, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s for,
For peace, they reach for a higher score.]]></description>

There was an argument about policy,
Between the right and the left so gaudy.
Republican vs Democrat,
It&rsquo;s a battle that&rsquo;s never quite done,
&lsquo;Til the boom or the bust of the economy.]]></description>

Putin&rsquo;s Forever War has created a fright,
The conflict in Ukraine&rsquo;s taking its flight.
South Africa lost to Sweden with a kick,
Kennedy&rsquo;s campaign leaving a mix.
Facial recognition false, eight months pregnant arrested, it&rsquo;s not right!]]></description>

There was a campaign path so rough,
With Trump&rsquo;s legal team in a bluff.
Ukraine started a new diplomatic push,
It&rsquo;s Putin the people must crush.
Jolted by mutiny his plan&rsquo;s gruff!]]></description>

Chris Christie visited Ukraine with a flail
He wanted to show an opponent he was not frail
But his plan was instead
To punch Vladimir&rsquo;s head
And put an end to this tech cold war battle]]></description>

In 2024 Race, Trump will try to outrun prosecutions
The court of public opinion he&rsquo;s using whataboutism
Ukraine producing more ammo, the war&rsquo;s sap global supply
And in the U.S. Fitch&rsquo;s rating took a dive
Feinstein&rsquo;s ailing and now her fortune&rsquo;s at stake
Which will lead to some battling and a family break.]]></description>

Trump&rsquo;s case had a meaning for democracy,
But now those implications remain a mystery.
The truth of what&rsquo;s done,
With a vengeance it&rsquo;s come,
For a Congress forced to exact its own remedy.]]></description>

Biden shores up Democratic votes,
But Trump still has some who dote,
Nikki Haley heads to the polls,
But Bernie still trolls,
Drone wars just spoil the boat.]]></description>
