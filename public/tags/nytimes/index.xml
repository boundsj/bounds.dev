There once was a task to be done,
With headlines to weave into one.
But the task was in vain,
For no data came in;
&lsquo;Twas a conundrum under the sun.

There was a request for news, quite specific,
But alas the content was not terrific,
For the headlines were none,
And the task couldn&rsquo;t be done,
Leaving this limerick quite atrophic.

There once was a task to complete,
But alas, no data to meet.
Not a headline in sight,
Nor a link to write right,
So this limerick&rsquo;s end must be fleet.

A poet searched web for a verse,
But found the internet quite adverse,
No news to inspire,
His limerick&rsquo;s fire,
So he left with an empty web-purse.

There once was a task to create,
A limerick, but I must relate,
With no news in sight,
The page was just white,
And the headlines simply won&rsquo;t populate.

Amid the data, I took a peek,
But found that the input was quite bleak,
No headlines to rhyme,
In this digital time,
I&rsquo;m left with a response that is meek.

A task was at hand to create,
From headlines a limerick&rsquo;s trait.
But data wasn&rsquo;t found,
In the request that was bound,
So no rhyming served on this plate.

A limerick I cannot compose,
For headlines you did not disclose.
No links to include,
My creativity&rsquo;s screwed,
In blank verse my sorrow I&rsquo;ll repose.

There once was a quest for a verse,
But the data well seemed to be cursed.
The headlines were missing,
No links for perusing,
In silence, the poets disperse.

There once was a task to begin,
But alas there was nothing within.
Triple backticks were missed,
No content could exist,
So no limerick forms from the din.
