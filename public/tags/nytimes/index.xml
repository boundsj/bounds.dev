There was a young coder, quite slick,
With a limerick task but no trick.
For the data was missing,
No headlines for kissing,
Just an empty collection to pick.
 These are the headlines that were used to create this post:]]></description>

There once were some headlines to make,
But alas, there was none to partake.
With no news to be found,
Not a story nor sound,
Just silence, no headlines to make.

There once was a headline with link,
Expected to make one think.
But lo and behold,
No story was told,
For data was gone in a blink.

There once was a task quite explicit,
With headlines to make a good lyric.
But the content provided,
Left me quite undecided,
For the input was sadly implicit.

There once was a task I did seek,
With headlines and links to critique.
But my search was in vain,
Not a headline to name,
For the collection you gave was quite bleak.

There once was a script set to check it,
But alas, there were none to collect it.
No headlines to use,
No links to peruse,
A response there was none to project it.

No reporting to write,
Just a quiet day with no news.

There was a young coder, quite stricken,
Whose data had suddenly quicken&rsquo;d,
Yet when he did peek,
No information to seek,
For the input was truly just stricken.

There once was a prompt quite explicit,
With headlines that seemed quite complicit.
But alas, in this case,
There&rsquo;s no news to chase,
And the limerick ends quite implicit.

Apologies, but it seems there&rsquo;s a mistake,
For no headlines are here for me to partake.
Not a link to be seen in digital space,
No content provided to build up this case,
So a limerick from nothing I cannot make.
