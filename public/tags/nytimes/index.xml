There once was a task to complete,
With headlines to make it so neat.
But the data was missing,
No stories for kissing,
So this limerick&rsquo;s feeling quite beat.

There once was a task to be done,
No data provided, not one.
So I sat with a sigh,
Couldnâ€™t write if I try,
A limerick without data is none.

I was asked to compose a rhyme,
Sadly, no headlines were shown at the time.
With no news at my beak,
This request seems quite bleak,
And has left me with nothing to chime.

There once was a prompt lacking data,
No links to click, later or beta.
With nothing to read,
No content to lead,
That prompt was as blank as a crater.

There was a request quite explicit,
With headlines to be analytic.
But the input was bare,
No news was there,
Just an echo of &lsquo;no data&rsquo; implicit.

A query was made by a user,
For headlines to make rhymes much truer.
But the data&rsquo;s not there,
Just an empty cold stare,
And the screen stayed as blank as a sewer.

There once was an eager AI,
Asked to rhyme with no data nigh.
With no news to peruse,
It had nothing to use,
And simply could not comply.

There simply was nothing to see,
No data was given to me.
I&rsquo;ve searched high and low,
No headlines do show,
So nothing to see or decree.

There once was a task to write news,
But alas, there were no headlines to use.
With no links to inspire,
The poet&rsquo;s job dire,
So an error in fetching, we deduce.
