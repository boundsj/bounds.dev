From migrants in skirts so light,
The walls they build offer no respite.
For Narges in jail,
At the border&rsquo;s prevail,
Her people no longer must fight.]]></description>

House was paralyzed with no speaker
When McCarthy&rsquo;s removal was much stronger than weaker

A former president named Trump,
Was being wrongfully prosecuted, what a bump!
Russia tested a nuke,
Slovakia allied with Russia, what a fluke!
Nobel Prize, Kati KarikÃ³, vaccine proved a true trump!]]></description>

A Congress faced strain, shutdown at risk,
But soon a solution they&rsquo;d miss,
With Biden&rsquo;s nod,
narrowly voted,
They said &ldquo;Dysfunction&rsquo;s an easy dish!]]></description>

An autumn shutdown made them quite tick,
Promises of relief made them sick.
House to Right said yes,
House to Left said less,
Agreement they couldn&rsquo;t quite get a fix.]]></description>

Talking peace in Sudan, the U.A.E.
Secretly fuels the fight in full sway.
Rain could cause flooding in New York City today,
Biden issued a blistering attack on Trump in the fray.
With a shutdown in view, Kevin McCarthy plays a weak hand,
Leaving citizens wondering &lsquo;How long will this stand?&rsquo;]]></description>

Republicans try to block blame,
Vulnerable to a shutdown game.
No one&rsquo;s gaining ground,
In Ukraine this year round,
Instead it&rsquo;s just fighting&rsquo;s same.
The debate on one night is seen,
Hope Trump won&rsquo;t pose a new regime.
Biden and Trump give a preview,
Who won? We can&rsquo;t even infer.
Silvery shimmer Beyonce did bring,
Corruption tight definition sting.]]></description>
