Too much debt and no chance of fair,
Republicans have a plan,
That&rsquo;s completely outrageous,
Left said it should&rsquo;ve gone in the air!]]></description>

The Royals of England named &ldquo;King Stone&rdquo;
Had inhabitants whose voices had grown
Once King Charles and Camilla
Had been crowned, they did holla
As anti-royalists gave their own groan!]]></description>

There was a gov&rsquo;t so corrupt,
Manipulated by a corruptor they&rsquo;d jet.
The bribes and embezzlement,
Was out of all sentiment,
It&rsquo;s no surprise it was such a big threat!]]></description>

In Berlin so discreetly, spies of the Soviet were seen.
Any changes were hidden, nothing to be seen.

There are London&rsquo;s other Royals, the &ldquo;Pearly&rsquo;s&rdquo;
Keeping Cockney customs alive with such ease
Charles&rsquo;s Coronation, a shrug
Whole Foods in Woes, a big bug
Cockney customs, a nod, no one&rsquo;s to freeze.]]></description>
