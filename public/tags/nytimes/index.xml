There was a young coder, quite stuck,
Requesting for news, out of luck.
No headlines to twist,
Just a void in the mist,
And left with the coder, that muck.
 These are the headlines that were used to create this post:]]></description>

A writer sought news in the net,
But found that no data was set.
With no tales to compose,
Just empty prose,
He penned a blank verse of regret.

There was a young user quite slick,
Who asked for new headlines so quick.
But the data was nil,
The response took some skill,
With no news, there&rsquo;s no limerick to pick.

There once were headlines to make rhyme,
But alas, they&rsquo;ve been lost in time.
No links to be clicked,
No events to be picked,
In a world without news, we&rsquo;re just fine.

There once was a task to complete,
With headlines to make it so neat.
But the data was missing,
No stories for kissing,
So this limerick&rsquo;s feeling quite beat.

There once was a task to be done,
No data provided, not one.
So I sat with a sigh,
Couldnâ€™t write if I try,
A limerick without data is none.

I was asked to compose a rhyme,
Sadly, no headlines were shown at the time.
With no news at my beak,
This request seems quite bleak,
And has left me with nothing to chime.

There once was a prompt lacking data,
No links to click, later or beta.
With nothing to read,
No content to lead,
That prompt was as blank as a crater.

There was a request quite explicit,
With headlines to be analytic.
But the input was bare,
No news was there,
Just an echo of &lsquo;no data&rsquo; implicit.

A query was made by a user,
For headlines to make rhymes much truer.
But the data&rsquo;s not there,
Just an empty cold stare,
And the screen stayed as blank as a sewer.
