Both sides paid a price so high,
For a city that caused them to sigh.
Large forces deployed,
To claim it they strive,
And so many on both sides have died.]]></description>

A weary old bear with a snout,
Was frustrated when birds set about,
&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m distressed!&quot;, he said,
&ldquo;They better not flee&rsquo;d,
Or else I will thump them right out!]]></description>

To trigger such havoc so great.
The lockdown so quick,
It left locals so sick,
As a manhunt stirred much more debate.]]></description>

There&rsquo;s a crisis in Gaza with bombs in the air,
For the Gazans, it&rsquo;s a test of their wear.
Israel declared a strike,
It sure caused a fright,
But escape from the bombs they still dare.]]></description>

So much strife in Israel and Gaza,
With the death toll that only did lag.

Israel launched many a strike so bold,
As the U.S. sought a diplomatic hold.

Concerns Rise That Israel-Hamas conflict will widen,
A struggle engulfed in a storm that will darken.
Qatar aided the US, to free two Americans with glee
But three weapons are needed by Israel and Ukraine to be free.
Bridge builders between sides, felt an opportunity shine,
But will it be enough with the conflict so entwined?]]></description>
