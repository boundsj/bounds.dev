There was an old web with no news,
A curious case that bemuse.
The headlines were bare,
Not a link found in there,
Leaving rhymers with nothing to use.

There once were some lines on the net,
Without any content to set.
No headline, no link,
Not a thing to rethink,
Just a limerick with no news to fret.

There once was a task to fulfill,
With headlines to bend to my will.
But alas and alack,
No news came to hack,
So this limerick hole I can&rsquo;t fill.

I pondered with Internet quiet,
No news to disturb or incite it,
With links all astray,
In quietude lay,
And silence enveloped the riot.

There once was a prompt full of quotes,
With headlines to float many boats.
But the data was missing,
No stories for kissing,
Just empty where one usually gloats.

I&rsquo;m sorry, my friend, for the mix-up,
It seems there&rsquo;s a part in the fix-up.
No headlines to see,
No links to decree,
I need them to fill my rhyme cup.

I&rsquo;m sorry but no can do,
You&rsquo;ve given me no clue to pursue.
No headlines, no link,
Makes it harder to think,
And create a limerick for you.

I searched for a headline with vim,
But found the content quite slim.
No news was in sight,
Not a link to alight,
A curious case, rather grim.

In Iowa, Trump&rsquo;s new voter appeal,
DeSantis&rsquo;s shadow in Florida does not congeal,
Biden&rsquo;s plea to Black voters, quite real,
While Japanese steel seeks a U.S. deal,
And a shutdown averted, with a budget seal.

A Boeing once flew with much fright,
A hole popped in flight caused a plight.
The Northeast got snow,
Travel plans a no-go,
No flying or driving that night.
