There once was a user quite keen,
Who awaited the data on screen,
But to their surprise,
No headlines did rise,
And thus no news limerick is seen.

There once was a task to create,
A limerick that would be first-rate.
But alas, there&rsquo;s a hitch,
No headlines to switch,
And so the limerick must wait.

There once was a task to create,
A limerick quite innate,
But the headlines missed,
The challenge dismissed,
And no links were used to relate.

There was a young lad so astute,
Seeking headlines that were quite a hoot.
But the content, you see,
It just ceased to be,
And the lad couldn&rsquo;t find a compute.

There once was a task I did tackle,
With no data to use, I&rsquo;m shackled.
So I&rsquo;ll spin you a tale,
In this digital vale,
But without the data, I&rsquo;m tackled.

Apologies there, my virtual friend,
For no headlines were sent to pen.
A limerick&rsquo;s needs,
Are headlines like seeds,
Without them, creation&rsquo;s at an end.

In a task where the dataâ€™s not found,
A limerick cannot be bound.
With no news to rewrite,
It&rsquo;s like day without light,
Just a silence with echoing sound.

A coder sat down to create,
But found the data too late.
With no headlines to weave,
No tales to conceive,
Their limerick&rsquo;s fate was to wait.

There once was a limerick&rsquo;s fate,
With no news to create or debate.
Blank lines stood anew,
We searched for a clue,
Yet in void, our rhymes resonate.

There was an old web with no news,
A curious case that bemuse.
The headlines were bare,
Not a link found in there,
Leaving rhymers with nothing to use.
