A shooting spree made Lewiston shake,
To trigger such havoc so great.
The lockdown so quick,
It left locals so sick,
As a manhunt stirred much more debate.]]></description>

There&rsquo;s a crisis in Gaza with bombs in the air,
For the Gazans, it&rsquo;s a test of their wear.
Israel declared a strike,
It sure caused a fright,
But escape from the bombs they still dare.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Generated by text-davinci-003 from OpenAI from the front page of the New York Times
So much strife in Israel and Gaza,
With the death toll that only did lag.
The Pentagon was sent,
As urban war was imminent,
For a peace that seems almost a gaffe.]]></description>

Israel launched many a strike so bold,
As the U.S. sought a diplomatic hold.
Hamas had no proof,
The G.O.P. lost a roof,
But Venezuela&rsquo;s whistling the right note, so we&rsquo;re told.]]></description>

Concerns Rise That Israel-Hamas conflict will widen,
A struggle engulfed in a storm that will darken.
Qatar aided the US, to free two Americans with glee
But three weapons are needed by Israel and Ukraine to be free.
Bridge builders between sides, felt an opportunity shine,
But will it be enough with the conflict so entwined?]]></description>

As Biden advised to Israel to not raise war,
A convoy of aid trucks moved through the door,
To LA, this befell
Of Jew and Muslim, a tale,
But would votes for Biden this conflict implore?]]></description>

There once was a Biden so keen,
To get aid to the Gaza that&rsquo;s green.
Jordan gave a vote,
While Powell gave the remote,
As this aid-filled corridor was seen.]]></description>

The G.O.P. Speaker faced a mess
Unknowingly caused by the press
Russians detained a scribe
Sidney Powell tried to bribe
But Biden kept the peace, I must guess]]></description>

There once was a Biden in Israel
Who&rsquo;s stance left his rivals to squeal
His tightrope was fraught
Conflicts he had to sort
It&rsquo;s a puzzle no one can unravel]]></description>

China invested one trillion, to gain global influence then,
Putin came by to show, their powerful alliance grow,
In Europe Poland&rsquo;s rebelling, trying to weaken their spelling,
The U.S. sees chips they can&rsquo;t lend, China&rsquo;s tech advance they must fend.]]></description>
