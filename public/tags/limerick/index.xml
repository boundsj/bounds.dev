There once was an AI quite slick,
Asked to write with a limerick&rsquo;s trick.
Without news for its verse,
Its circuits did curse,
But it smiled, for it knew a neat trick.

There once was a prompt with no tales,
No headlines or links to unveil.
With nothing to write,
In the blankness, I sigh,
And in the silence, my efforts do pale.

There once was a task to compose,
A limerick with headlines to disclose.
But the data was missed,
So the task was dismissed,
And now the attempt simply dozes.

There was a task with a twist, pretty slick,
With headlines and links to hand-pick.
But the content was void,
No stories to be enjoyed,
Just this line, and no limerick to click.

There once was a task to complete,
For a limerick that would be quite a feat.
But the content was missed,
The headlines not kissed,
So sadly, I must now hit retreat.

A writer found headlines were none,
In his task to create some fun pun.
He sat with a sigh,
His screen just awry,
And realized the headlines had run.

There once was a prompt without data,
With headlines and links in the beta.
But the coder was keen,
With his screen nice and clean,
And the task completed, no later.

There once was a prompt without head,
That left the AI quite underfed.
No news to recite,
In the absence of light,
It crafted from nothing instead.

There once was a task to complete,
With headlines to make something neat.
But the data was missing,
No links for assisting,
Just empty space, no deceit.
