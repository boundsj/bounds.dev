There once was a quest for a verse,
But the data well seemed to be cursed.
The headlines were missing,
No links for perusing,
In silence, the poets disperse.

There once was a task to begin,
But alas there was nothing within.
Triple backticks were missed,
No content could exist,
So no limerick forms from the din.

There once was a task I did seek,
With data that should be unique,
But found to my plight,
No headlines in sight,
So silence is what I must speak.

There was a young coder, quite slick,
With a limerick task but no trick.
For the data was missing,
No headlines for kissing,
Just an empty collection to pick.

There once were some headlines to make,
But alas, there was none to partake.
With no news to be found,
Not a story nor sound,
Just silence, no headlines to make.

There once was a headline with link,
Expected to make one think.
But lo and behold,
No story was told,
For data was gone in a blink.

There once was a task quite explicit,
With headlines to make a good lyric.
But the content provided,
Left me quite undecided,
For the input was sadly implicit.

There once was a task I did seek,
With headlines and links to critique.
But my search was in vain,
Not a headline to name,
For the collection you gave was quite bleak.

There once was a script set to check it,
But alas, there were none to collect it.
No headlines to use,
No links to peruse,
A response there was none to project it.

No headlines to browse or peruse.
Not a story in sight,
No reporting to write,
Just a quiet day with no news.
