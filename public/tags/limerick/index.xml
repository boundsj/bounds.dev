There simply was nothing to see,
No data was given to me.
I&rsquo;ve searched high and low,
No headlines do show,
So nothing to see or decree.

There once was a task to complete,
With headlines to make it so neat.
But the data was lacking,
No stories for backing,
The task was impossible feat.

There once was a task to write news,
But alas, there were no headlines to use.
With no links to inspire,
The poet&rsquo;s job dire,
So an error in fetching, we deduce.

There once was a prompt without news,
Which left the AI quite confused.
No headlines to read,
No links did it need,
For the facts were entirely diffused.

There was a young coder quite slick,
Who tried to process data quick.
But with no info to see,
They just shrugged, &lsquo;Woe is me!',
And couldn&rsquo;t compose a new trick.

There once was an AI quite slick,
Asked to write with a limerick&rsquo;s trick.
Without news for its verse,
Its circuits did curse,
But it smiled, for it knew a neat trick.

There once was a prompt with no tales,
No headlines or links to unveil.
With nothing to write,
In the blankness, I sigh,
And in the silence, my efforts do pale.

There once was a task to compose,
A limerick with headlines to disclose.
But the data was missed,
So the task was dismissed,
And now the attempt simply dozes.

There was a task with a twist, pretty slick,
With headlines and links to hand-pick.
But the content was void,
No stories to be enjoyed,
Just this line, and no limerick to click.
