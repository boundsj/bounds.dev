A Biden so lavish and keen,
For India&rsquo;s prime minister Modi has planned a grand scene.
A fine welcome and wait,
No single life to date,
For his family is the great Indian scene.]]></description>

Narendra Modi so popular,
No one knows why, it&rsquo;s absurd.
Business leaders greet him,
He&rsquo;s a global phenomenon,
And Biden won&rsquo;t raise a word.]]></description>

Trump just did a real-estate deal
In the Sultanate of Oman, a big ordeal
Greek guard&rsquo;s fierce scrutiny
Has migrants that drown in agony
Verbonians must leave for the squalor to heal!]]></description>

Tensions when Blinken met Xi,
Angst between China and U.S.
Both look to each other and sigh,
With unhelpful replies
To avoid any untoward ties,
The world waits to see who will buy.]]></description>

The destruction of the Kakhovka Dam
Was likely an inside job, ma&rsquo;am.
DeSantis with kids,
Didn&rsquo;t mention the biz,
But Trump is there facing the slam.]]></description>

Biden seeks for a Saudi-Israel deal,
But peace agreements can often feel real,
Long-shots take some time,
But it will be sublime,
If Mideast hopes come around to appeal.]]></description>

Trump and Johnson did something quite vile,
Accused of breaking rules in style.
One lost party&rsquo;s support,
But the optics were short,
As turbulent politics reign a while.]]></description>

As ties to China turn toxic, even there,
Chinese companies break them with great care.
Boris Johnson misled,
A nuclear crisis, U.S. seeks,
And Oregon&rsquo;s marijuana boom grants Idaho despair.]]></description>

Europeans take a major charge,
To ensure A.I. doesn&rsquo;t grow too large,
Robots can see the light,
But must stay out of sight,

Donald Trump has options to fight,
But his fate won&rsquo;t be put right.
His foes contest,
But his lawyers suggest,
That the case could be out of sight!]]></description>
