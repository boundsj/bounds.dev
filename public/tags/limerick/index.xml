He claimed it was for his honour and pride,
But the evidence stacked up, in quite a big lump,
He was left feeling, confused and denied.
The Times analysed the indictment all sealed,
The details we soon, then revealed
But all of the fuss,
Was really because
Of the woman, hush money, Stormy Daniels appealed.]]></description>

Donald Trump needs a strong defense
But his rivals are quite dense
They&rsquo;ll need others to shield

A fox gained renown in the USA,
For all the cash sent his way.
He hoped to evade their embrace,
But all that he found was disgrace.
Certain justice was due to this day.]]></description>

Ukraine&rsquo;s troops set out from a hub,
Their mission to Bakhmut, talons a-rub.
Turkey and Finland,
Their alliance to mend,
While Mexico mourns a horrific fire and dub.
Guo Wengui, to fraud and crime linked,
His fortune? now greatly diminished.
Immigrants rushed in,
As US populations thin,
And a teenager&rsquo;s online grudges pointed the blame stick.]]></description>
