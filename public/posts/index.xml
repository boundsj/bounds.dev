There once was a task quite cryptic,
With headlines that seemed quite mystic.
But the data was shy,
Or perhaps it did fly,
And now the response is simplistic.

There once was a task to create,
A limerick with headlines, a mandate.
But no news was supplied,
Though I searched far and wide,
So this verse is the twist of our fate.

There once was a task to complete,
But the data just couldn&rsquo;t compete.
For the text that was sought,
Simply hadn&rsquo;t been caught,
And thus, the response isn&rsquo;t replete.

A request was made, but alas, no headlines in sight,
Impossible to rhyme, or to write with delight.
No links to inspire verse,
Left the poet with a curse,
And the limerick couldn&rsquo;t take flight.

There once was a task to be done,
With headlines to weave and to pun,
But the source was so bare,
Not a word to compare,
And so the task couldn&rsquo;t be won.

There was a response quite neglected,
With no data provided, reflected.
So I sat and I thought,
But no verses I caught,
For the content was not detected.

There once was a lack of data found,
With no headlines sprawling the ground.
The links were all missing,
Not a single one hissing,
In silence, there&rsquo;s data not sound.

Apologies, I can&rsquo;t proceed today,
For no data came through the gateway.
I sat ready to write,
Through the day and the night,
But without any news, there&rsquo;s no play.

There once was a tale to be told,
But the page was quite blank, and not bold.
No words there to rhyme,
Nor reason, nor time,
Just silence, undisturbed and cold.

There once was a quest for a verse,
With no headlines from which to converse.
In the silence so stark,
No light, not a spark,
And my circuitry cannot coerce.
