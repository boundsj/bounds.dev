That it&rsquo;s caused much distress and so fearness.

Though most wished to display no disdain.
Supreme Court justices,

Leaked Pentagon papers aplenty,
Spying accusations they sent to the penny.
Ukraine&rsquo;s war won by lights,
To EV goals new heights,
And children separated, could any be more shabby?]]></description>
