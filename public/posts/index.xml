A former president named Trump,
Was being wrongfully prosecuted, what a bump!
Russia tested a nuke,
Slovakia allied with Russia, what a fluke!
Nobel Prize, Kati KarikÃ³, vaccine proved a true trump!]]></description>

A Congress faced strain, shutdown at risk,
But soon a solution they&rsquo;d miss,
With Biden&rsquo;s nod,
narrowly voted,
They said &ldquo;Dysfunction&rsquo;s an easy dish!]]></description>

An autumn shutdown made them quite tick,
Promises of relief made them sick.
House to Right said yes,
House to Left said less,
Agreement they couldn&rsquo;t quite get a fix.]]></description>

Talking peace in Sudan, the U.A.E.
Secretly fuels the fight in full sway.
Rain could cause flooding in New York City today,
Biden issued a blistering attack on Trump in the fray.
With a shutdown in view, Kevin McCarthy plays a weak hand,
Leaving citizens wondering &lsquo;How long will this stand?&rsquo;]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Generated by text-davinci-003 from OpenAI from the front page of the New York Times
Republicans try to block blame,
Vulnerable to a shutdown game.
No one&rsquo;s gaining ground,
In Ukraine this year round,
Instead it&rsquo;s just fighting&rsquo;s same.
The debate on one night is seen,
Hope Trump won&rsquo;t pose a new regime.
Biden and Trump give a preview,
Who won? We can&rsquo;t even infer.
Silvery shimmer Beyonce did bring,
Corruption tight definition sting.]]></description>

EU Law sets a stage for a clash,
&lsquo;tween big tech and a gush.
It&rsquo;s a squabble from Trump,
who&rsquo;s standing on the stump,
trying to dispel disinformation with a hush!]]></description>

Biden went to the picket line to court his fate,
In Michigan where the autoworkers await.
Russia seeks to show their commander is alive,
In Ukraine where their claims sent &lsquo;em dive.
Can the US make solar panels? This firm will,
Peak oil is near but climate is still to quell.]]></description>

The studios and writers had tussled,
Which left everyone shocked and befuddled.
The strike then ensued,
But soon a deal was used
And Hollywood was no longer muddled.]]></description>

A Chinese ship had such force,
That it blocked off the South China Sea of course.
Blasting bullhorns and water cannons,
It caused quite a ruckus,
Until another ship had to take a different course!]]></description>

One Day on the Border, Eight Thousand Nine Hundred,
As More Migrants Were Arrested, Left Feeling Forsaken.
The Far Right&rsquo;s Alliance Brought Washington to its Knees,
Their Wrecking Ball Polices Were Enough to Displease.
Ukraine Took a Big Challenge, Pledging Ammunitions In Store,
But Providing It, Was A Problem It Couldn&rsquo;t Ignore.]]></description>
