Southwest will face flooding &lsquo;Catastrophic&rsquo;,
Hilary&rsquo;s near, but no one&rsquo;s ecstatic.
In Hell&rsquo;s heat, folks swelter
When Doyle&rsquo;s wildfire comes to belittle.

Who felt that things had gotten too tight.
The U.S., Japan, and Korea,
United in front now, we see.
But will it last through the night?]]></description>

A case in Georgia, such a buzz,
Prosecutor Fani gives a fuss.

High-level decision flaws,
Will Trump face arrest, we must discuss?]]></description>

Deborah Pearlstein and Garret Keizer,
Diana Nyad and Alex de Waal too,

With death tolls and flames to the people it curses.
The evacuations came late,
But digital repatriate,
The Rosetta stone and won once more hearts averse.]]></description>
