Dangerous heat stretched with dismay,
Uncontrolled, day after day.
In offices still,
Sensors could fill,
Air from disasters to stay.]]></description>

There was a great migration to Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard,
Where migrants could feel secure and unhurried.
For safety and security they craved,
In this land of hope they were saved,
And found a new home that wasn&rsquo;t so harried.]]></description>

A Russian Warlord sought to prevail,
But a judge put his efforts to fail.
Bidenomics revealed,
Trump&rsquo;s hold lost appeal,
So DeSantis took aim, no avail.]]></description>

The U.S.-China Rivalry causes such strife,
That debt crisis will add to the strife,
Messi&rsquo;s gone and Mbappe is grey,
What&rsquo;s next for Neymar to play?
It&rsquo;s an international battle for life.]]></description>

In Russia a rebellion did start,
Which had Putin&rsquo;s worst fears a-part.
Yevgeny Prigozhin
Had tanks ready to spin,
But it proved to have no long start.]]></description>

A leader from Wagner caused ire,
A military revolt did transpire.
Putin struck a tough tone,
Open confrontation shown,
In hopes of ending the fire.]]></description>

Ukraine&rsquo;s fighters are primed for a fight,
China sends gunpowder with might.
Kakhovka saw a strike,
A year without Roe,
Where the clinics close one does not write.
Secret Navy sensors detected a heat,
The Titan that went to its defeat.
James Cameron knew the flaw,
To Charleston for a journey of woe,
Far Right spins its tale to the street.]]></description>

A Biden so lavish and keen,
For India&rsquo;s prime minister Modi has planned a grand scene.
A fine welcome and wait,
No single life to date,
For his family is the great Indian scene.]]></description>

Narendra Modi so popular,
No one knows why, it&rsquo;s absurd.
Business leaders greet him,
He&rsquo;s a global phenomenon,
And Biden won&rsquo;t raise a word.]]></description>

Trump just did a real-estate deal
In the Sultanate of Oman, a big ordeal
Greek guard&rsquo;s fierce scrutiny
Has migrants that drown in agony
Verbonians must leave for the squalor to heal!]]></description>
