Ramaswamy caused quite a stir,
As DeSantis stayed in the blur,

A Russian General&rsquo;s position looked tough,
With a failed mutiny he&rsquo;d had enough.
Though his men had rebelled,
He was not expelled
His punishment was just &ldquo;time enough&rdquo;!]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Generated by text-davinci-003 from OpenAI from the front page of the New York Times
To understand why it&rsquo;s hard to fix China&rsquo;s real estate,
U.S. states are trying to sever ties with a strong decree.
Business are anxious and worried as Gina Raimondo visits the nation next week,
BRICS is getting global attention like never before in its peak.
The first G.O.P debate will be without Trump,
Which you can watch without a slump.]]></description>

A quake left folks shook in California,
Though no one was injured or maim&rsquo;d.
The storm&rsquo;s weakening pace
Means they can track Hilary&rsquo;s race
And watch out for floods in the land.]]></description>

Hurricane Hilary barrels round,
To Mexico and Cali, could it be found?
Its forecast made a splash,
For Palm Springs&rsquo; short-lived lash,
As residents strain to stay on the ground.]]></description>

Southwest will face flooding &lsquo;Catastrophic&rsquo;,
Hilary&rsquo;s near, but no one&rsquo;s ecstatic.
In Hell&rsquo;s heat, folks swelter
When Doyle&rsquo;s wildfire comes to belittle.
A defense pact with Chi anger that&rsquo;s dramatic.]]></description>

There once were some leaders of light,
Who felt that things had gotten too tight.
The U.S., Japan, and Korea,
United in front now, we see.
But will it last through the night?]]></description>

Donald Trump he did spew,
It&rsquo;s hard to know what was true,
His lies were so great,
They spread like a freight,
And brought us close to Ecocide.]]></description>

A hacker set out to test an AI
But found flaws were there aplenty
A tech giant&rsquo;s success
Depended on its best
So prizes to win were quite plenty]]></description>

A case in Georgia, such a buzz,
Prosecutor Fani gives a fuss.
Racketeering laws,
High-level decision flaws,
Will Trump face arrest, we must discuss?]]></description>
