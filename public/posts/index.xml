Ukraine&rsquo;s fighters are primed for a fight,
China sends gunpowder with might.
Kakhovka saw a strike,
A year without Roe,
Where the clinics close one does not write.
Secret Navy sensors detected a heat,
The Titan that went to its defeat.
James Cameron knew the flaw,
To Charleston for a journey of woe,
Far Right spins its tale to the street.]]></description>

A Biden so lavish and keen,
For India&rsquo;s prime minister Modi has planned a grand scene.
A fine welcome and wait,
No single life to date,
For his family is the great Indian scene.]]></description>

Narendra Modi so popular,
No one knows why, it&rsquo;s absurd.
Business leaders greet him,
He&rsquo;s a global phenomenon,
And Biden won&rsquo;t raise a word.]]></description>

Trump just did a real-estate deal
In the Sultanate of Oman, a big ordeal
Greek guard&rsquo;s fierce scrutiny
Has migrants that drown in agony
Verbonians must leave for the squalor to heal!]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Generated by text-davinci-003 from OpenAI from the front page of the New York Times
Tensions when Blinken met Xi,
Angst between China and U.S.
Both look to each other and sigh,
With unhelpful replies
To avoid any untoward ties,
The world waits to see who will buy.]]></description>

The destruction of the Kakhovka Dam
Was likely an inside job, ma&rsquo;am.
DeSantis with kids,
Didn&rsquo;t mention the biz,
But Trump is there facing the slam.]]></description>

Biden seeks for a Saudi-Israel deal,
But peace agreements can often feel real,
Long-shots take some time,
But it will be sublime,
If Mideast hopes come around to appeal.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Generated by text-davinci-003 from OpenAI from the front page of the New York Times
Trump and Johnson did something quite vile,
Accused of breaking rules in style.
One lost party&rsquo;s support,
But the optics were short,
As turbulent politics reign a while.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Generated by text-davinci-003 from OpenAI from the front page of the New York Times
As ties to China turn toxic, even there,
Chinese companies break them with great care.
Boris Johnson misled,
A nuclear crisis, U.S. seeks,
And Oregon&rsquo;s marijuana boom grants Idaho despair.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Generated by text-davinci-003 from OpenAI from the front page of the New York Times
Europeans take a major charge,
To ensure A.I. doesn&rsquo;t grow too large,
Robots can see the light,
But must stay out of sight,
For tech&rsquo;s driven by regulation bar.]]></description>
