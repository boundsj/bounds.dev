In the political sphere,
Biden promised to help out Ukraine.
Zelensky denied, Bakhmut is not defied,
But F-16s could help them now see.
Sanctions Trump had given,
Minerals aplenty driven,
G7 hopes to escape China&rsquo;s domination.
Emanuel pushed Japan far,
Crossed through jungle, migrants are,
Debt limit Biden claims time to spar.
Scott focused on Black Republicans,]]></description>

Ukraine&rsquo;s new leader sought aid at G7,
His plea for F-16s was a demand.
Though popular at home,
The leaders did moan,
For they feared it would cause a commotion.]]></description>

There once was a G7 Summit for sure,
And a plea from Zelensky to allure.
China&rsquo;s playbook was borrowed,
A lesson for tomorrow,
For the G7&rsquo;s economic tour.]]></description>

Russia and Ukraine&rsquo;s plight,
With each other they fiercely fight.

Drug shortages are near an all-time high,
Leading to rationing and strife.
Though Biden cut short his trip,
In Italy floods take a dip -
The future of Europe&rsquo;s not bright!]]></description>

Biden and McCarthy were soon to speak,
On the debt limit, they took quite a peak.
Microsoft AI showed signs of thought,
And OpenAI&rsquo;s CEO fought,
For some regulation to make it unique.]]></description>

Erdogan&rsquo;s fate was looking bleak,
He thought he&rsquo;d achieved a strong peak,
But it&rsquo;s now to the polls,
Where votes determine the roles,
And a second round may be what he&rsquo;ll seek.]]></description>

Erdogan&rsquo;s election in Turkey
Will stir western relief and cause Moscow anxiety.
Conversations about asylum
Make for a complicated congressional task.
Anxiety and relief in migrant camps,
It was worth it when they reach our land&rsquo;s ramps.
With dreams of a better life
They survive danger and strife,
It&rsquo;s a daily game of Russian roulette in these camps.]]></description>

Intent on their goals,
Will rivalry soon expose!]]></description>
