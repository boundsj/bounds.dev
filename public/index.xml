There was a collection so bare,
With no headlines at all to declare.
No links were to click,
No content to pick,
Just silence, as light as the air.
 These are the headlines that were used to create this post:]]></description>

In search of some news, I did frown,
For the headlines were simply not found.
I looked high and low,
But it was all for show,
As the internet data&rsquo;s unbound.

A user once searched with ambition,
For headlines to fit a tradition.
But the data was none,
The task couldn&rsquo;t be done,
&lsquo;Twas a quest that lacked proper ammunition.

There once was a task to embark,
But found no headlines in the dark.
With no news to inspire,
There&rsquo;s no verse to transpire,
That&rsquo;s the truth, plain and stark.

There once was a task to create,
A limerick from news that was great.
But alas there was none,
No headlines, no fun,
No links to start the debate.

In search of a headline to verse,
I found the collection was terse.
With nothing to read,
No stories to lead,
I crafted this meta limerick first.

There once was a task to be done,
No headlines for puns, not a one.
So I sat with a blink,
At the screen, tried to think,
But without any news, there was none.

There once was a task to be done,
With headlines and links, not one.
But with nothing to read,
No limerick to breed,
This task was no limerick fun.

There once was an empty collection,
Devoid of all news and direction.
No stories to tell,
Or links to dispel,
The void mismatched all detection.

There once was an error quite strict,
Which said headlines were something it missed.
So it couldnâ€™t proceed,
To fulfill the limerick need,
Leaving patterns of rhyme to persist.
