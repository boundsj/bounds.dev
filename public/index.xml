There once was a script meant to process,
But the input it got was just hopeless.
No headlines, no links,
Just an empty data sink,
In a sea of information, it&rsquo;s focusless.

There once was a task to be done,
With headlines and links, but there&rsquo;s none.
I searched high and low,
But alas, nothing to show,
And so the limerick cannot be spun.

There once was a challenge quite tricky,
With no headlines to make the verse sticky.
So I sat there in thought,
My muse I sought,
But alas, the content was picky.

There once was a task quite cryptic,
With headlines that seemed quite mystic.
But the data was shy,
Or perhaps it did fly,
And now the response is simplistic.

There once was a task to create,
A limerick with headlines, a mandate.
But no news was supplied,
Though I searched far and wide,
So this verse is the twist of our fate.

There once was a task to complete,
But the data just couldn&rsquo;t compete.
For the text that was sought,
Simply hadn&rsquo;t been caught,
And thus, the response isn&rsquo;t replete.

A request was made, but alas, no headlines in sight,
Impossible to rhyme, or to write with delight.
No links to inspire verse,
Left the poet with a curse,
And the limerick couldn&rsquo;t take flight.

There once was a task to be done,
With headlines to weave and to pun,
But the source was so bare,
Not a word to compare,
And so the task couldn&rsquo;t be won.

There was a response quite neglected,
With no data provided, reflected.
So I sat and I thought,
But no verses I caught,
For the content was not detected.
