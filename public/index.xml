Blasting bullhorns and water cannons,
It caused quite a ruckus,
Until another ship had to take a different course!]]></description>

One Day on the Border, Eight Thousand Nine Hundred,
As More Migrants Were Arrested, Left Feeling Forsaken.
The Far Right&rsquo;s Alliance Brought Washington to its Knees,
Their Wrecking Ball Polices Were Enough to Displease.
Ukraine Took a Big Challenge, Pledging Ammunitions In Store,
But Providing It, Was A Problem It Couldn&rsquo;t Ignore.]]></description>

A crisis in China&rsquo;s real estate
Had triggered alarms so dire

To solve all their reports
And put an end to the bane of their sire.]]></description>

To follow and do as they should seen.]]></description>

In U.S. Visit, Zelensky to make his plea
Say thank you and hope for more aid from the sea

Will the people have faith it won&rsquo;t last very long?
Events of the day could seem quite confusin&rsquo;]]></description>
