Chris Christie visited Ukraine with a flail
He wanted to show an opponent he was not frail
But his plan was instead
To punch Vladimir&rsquo;s head
And put an end to this tech cold war battle]]></description>

In 2024 Race, Trump will try to outrun prosecutions
The court of public opinion he&rsquo;s using whataboutism
Ukraine producing more ammo, the war&rsquo;s sap global supply
And in the U.S. Fitch&rsquo;s rating took a dive
Feinstein&rsquo;s ailing and now her fortune&rsquo;s at stake
Which will lead to some battling and a family break.]]></description>

Trump&rsquo;s case had a meaning for democracy,
But now those implications remain a mystery.
The truth of what&rsquo;s done,
With a vengeance it&rsquo;s come,
For a Congress forced to exact its own remedy.]]></description>

Biden shores up Democratic votes,
But Trump still has some who dote,
Nikki Haley heads to the polls,
But Bernie still trolls,
Drone wars just spoil the boat.]]></description>

Trump&rsquo;s crushing DeSantis and GOP foes,
Caused Ron to suggest more attacks that&rsquo;d go low.
Missiles that strike,
Spending that&rsquo;s tight,
All cause global political woes.
Heard &lsquo;round the world, Ukraine&rsquo;s pleas,
Saudi Arabia might aid, if you please.
Phoenix&rsquo;s hellish month of heat,
Economy&rsquo;s hit with a defeat.
The Soccer Moms, whose game has changed,]]></description>

There was a debate in India so fair,
&lsquo;Twas a crisis full of dispair.
Politicians spoke of votes and such,
Could not ignore ethnic conflict too much.
So India awaits its fate with care.]]></description>

With Starlink, Musk&rsquo;s reign&rsquo;s in alarm,
In Ukraine ports now feel its harm,
From Portland&rsquo;s fires
To Texas desires,
A world in upheaval so charm!
E-Bikes a danger for the young,
Israeli law causes strife not fun,
African nations
in succession coup rotations,
Little Canada, tales of throng.
Retire or not, not the will,
French win, US team pushed downhill,]]></description>

A man named Trump had some trouble,
Charged with crimes, what a rumble!
Documents added to his case,
He&rsquo;d better pick up the pace,
To dodge his legal death&rsquo;s-knell&rsquo;s thunderstruck double.]]></description>

An economy from the US did grow,
But then it had some unions to show.
The ECB also raised
&lsquo;Cause inflation braised;
Putin sweetened the pot with some grain, though.
Kyiv&rsquo;s advance got a wall,
And Oligarchs had million-dollar stalls.
Elite colleges saw
A legacy boost, a flaw;
The US meanwhile had a flash of brilliance sure to maul.]]></description>

The Texas governor causes much ire,
Their push on the limits of power much higher.
From Ukraine to the DMZ,
Trolls follow P.S.G.,
Now Biden&rsquo;s the target of their ire!]]></description>
