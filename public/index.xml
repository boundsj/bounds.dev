A man from Delaware with $1 million at home,
Sought real estate to explore on his own.
He chose Idaho and North Carolina too,
And with a friend, went house-hunting, it&rsquo;s true.
A NYC pad near Central Park made their dreams soar,
With a price tag of $75 million, that&rsquo;s sure to astound the rich and the poor!]]></description>

For a city that caused them to sigh.

A weary old bear with a snout,

To trigger such havoc so great.

It left locals so sick,
As a manhunt stirred much more debate.]]></description>
