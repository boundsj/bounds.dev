Pressured their base on abortion, the Republicans strain,
Though most wished to display no disdain.
Supreme Court justices,
Their ruling may miss us,
While South Korea&rsquo;s enraged by the gain.
Leaked Pentagon papers aplenty,
Spying accusations they sent to the penny.
Ukraine&rsquo;s war won by lights,
To EV goals new heights,
And children separated, could any be more shabby?]]></description>

The real-world costs of the digital race,
For Bitcoin drove investors apace.
To security breach,
Ukraine&rsquo;s in peril at least,
Unless reinforced with a shell from the chase.]]></description>

So this is what I&rsquo;ll tell you for sure:

Golf&rsquo;s European Tour felt a shun,
When some players chose to move on.

Many players to blame,
For Masters&rsquo; Tradition-Bound no fun!]]></description>

Donald Trump pleaded with &lsquo;not guilty&rsquo; plight
He claimed it was for his honour and pride,
But the evidence stacked up, in quite a big lump,
He was left feeling, confused and denied.
The Times analysed the indictment all sealed,
The details we soon, then revealed
But all of the fuss,
Was really because
Of the woman, hush money, Stormy Daniels appealed.]]></description>

For political intent, he
Must answer the court and obey.]]></description>

Donald Trump needs a strong defense
But his rivals are quite dense
They&rsquo;ll need others to shield
And a 2024 ordeal
So the case against him won&rsquo;t commence]]></description>
