Intent on their goals,

Families in fear of more losses,
Began to head to the border&rsquo;s crossings.

To prepare for the incoming migrants&rsquo; schools.

Now immigrants bring a new dimension.]]></description>

Once politicians met Covid with woe,
That changed when U.S. shifted to &ldquo;peacetime&rdquo; mode.
Then George Santos turned up, but still in contention,
For Trump such a verdict&rsquo;s harder to spin.
For the government, Biden provides clues,
To avoid default and make the news.
Companies now seek to shop til we drop,
But in Ukraine death is still everywhere a-flop.]]></description>

Biden and McCarthy discussed the debt limit,
But there was not much time left to commit.
Putin kept defying,
Khan was arresting,
And New York was dealing with how to make kids read it.]]></description>

In Debt Ceiling Talks folks do despair,
Too much debt and no chance of fair,
Republicans have a plan,
That&rsquo;s completely outrageous,
Left said it should&rsquo;ve gone in the air!]]></description>

Biden seeks troops down on the border,
To combat the migrant surge and disorder.
For Ukraine, drones were sent,
A way for them to vent,
While at home, some are renewed, some arerent.]]></description>

The Royals of England named &ldquo;King Stone&rdquo;
Had inhabitants whose voices had grown
Once King Charles and Camilla
Had been crowned, they did holla
As anti-royalists gave their own groan!]]></description>

As a King is crowned, some Britons ask why,
The monarchy persists, no matter how high
It&rsquo;s the same since old time,
As the story goes on to rhyme
But the answer remains still a surprise!]]></description>

There was a gov&rsquo;t so corrupt,
Manipulated by a corruptor they&rsquo;d jet.
The bribes and embezzlement,
Was out of all sentiment,
It&rsquo;s no surprise it was such a big threat!]]></description>

Facing conflicting signals from fed,
Manufacturing dropped with a dread.
A rate rise expected,
Ukraine&rsquo;s drone suspected,
And &lsquo;peace dividend&rsquo; felt as a dread.]]></description>
