The Ukraine War dictated the fate,
Of a firm caught in political state.
Choosing choice o&rsquo;er biz,
Would surely cause its demise,
But still a dark cloud over them loom&rsquo;d of late.]]></description>

There was a plan to mix up the school,
Instead of affirmative action, make it cool.
Diverse applicants, from all over the land,
To ensure a fair chance, lend a hand.
No matter the race or ethnicity,
A great education&rsquo;s the key to a great society.]]></description>

In the Supreme Court a ruling one day,
Triggering change, both large and small one way.

To nature the policies we seek.
Or else the consequences will loud and quite blunt say.]]></description>

There was a great migration to Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard,
Where migrants could feel secure and unhurried.
For safety and security they craved,
In this land of hope they were saved,
And found a new home that wasn&rsquo;t so harried.]]></description>
