In U.S. Visit, Zelensky to make his plea
Say thank you and hope for more aid from the sea

But will it be enough for the country to achieve?
The crisis of migrants still rampant and strong
Will the people have faith it won&rsquo;t last very long?
Events of the day could seem quite confusin&rsquo;]]></description>

Politicians charged millions from the start,
To send migrants on through DariÃ©n Gap.
The nightmare unfold with no end in sight,
The scramble for rescuers a chaotic flight.
