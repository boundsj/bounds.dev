Accused of breaking rules in style.
One lost party&rsquo;s support,
But the optics were short,
As turbulent politics reign a while.]]></description>

As ties to China turn toxic, even there,
Chinese companies break them with great care.
Boris Johnson misled,
A nuclear crisis, U.S. seeks,
And Oregon&rsquo;s marijuana boom grants Idaho despair.]]></description>

Europeans take a major charge,
To ensure A.I. doesn&rsquo;t grow too large,
Robots can see the light,
But must stay out of sight,
For tech&rsquo;s driven by regulation bar.]]></description>

Donald Trump has options to fight,
But his fate won&rsquo;t be put right.
His foes contest,
But his lawyers suggest,
That the case could be out of sight!]]></description>

Fear, mayhem and defiance there&rsquo;s no mistaking,
The war in Ukraine keeps on escalating.
NATO takes a stand with bold drills so stark,
But Trump&rsquo;s indicted with evidence from his own lawyer&rsquo;s mark.
Berlusconi&rsquo;s gone, the Italian showman demise,
Noise may take years off your life, a surprise.
When a former toxic waste site&rsquo;s found,
No one around will answer the sound.]]></description>

When Trump&rsquo;s admirers took their defense up a notch,
Experts were disturbed by the violent retort.
A personal aide was caught
As Trump&rsquo;s co-conspirator, sought
But the final battle was his court.]]></description>

A former President named Trump,
A criminal case was the bump,
The news took a dive,
To Miami it did arrive,
Can this saga ever be trumped?]]></description>

A lady from Ukraine did go
with the garb of a farmer in tow
across the border to Kherson
they sought to repent their transgression
though politics soon made things quite slow.]]></description>

Wildfires around the great North,
Fill the skies with hefty amounts of smoke.
Weakens many a man&rsquo;s health,
From distances it&rsquo;s felt,
Making many just dejected and glum.]]></description>
