A case in Georgia, such a buzz,
Prosecutor Fani gives a fuss.
Racketeering laws,
High-level decision flaws,
Will Trump face arrest, we must discuss?]]></description>

Deborah Pearlstein and Garret Keizer,
Diana Nyad and Alex de Waal too,
They wanted a say,
In the U.S.A.&lsquo;s day,
So they all ran the politics race too!]]></description>

Maui toll rises to ninety-three,
State sirens also had not been seen.
Though warnings had missed,
A lucky home kissed
From the ashes, they were still clean.]]></description>

Satellite images show the Lahaina flames,
Devastated residents in despair came.
Ukraine called for ammo,
While Hollywood&rsquo;s strike did go,
Viewers had a new chance to become game.]]></description>

Maui&rsquo;s in a crisis, its woes only grow worse,
With death tolls and flames to the people it curses.
The evacuations came late,
But digital repatriate,
The Rosetta stone and won once more hearts averse.]]></description>

There once was a town full of strife,
When wildfires scrambled their life.
It brought them such woe,
As kin they did know,
Saw homes they would never get to strife.]]></description>

In Ohio there seemed to be consternation,
For a GOP change was the sensation.
Voters denied the move,
For abortion to prove,
That it can shape election resultation.]]></description>

Don&rsquo;t be so picky about a job,
In China, that&rsquo;s a lesson they&rsquo;d sob.
What cuisine means to Taiwan
With China brings an issue so plain.
Two cultures clash, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s for,
For peace, they reach for a higher score.]]></description>

There was an argument about policy,
Between the right and the left so gaudy.
Republican vs Democrat,
It&rsquo;s a battle that&rsquo;s never quite done,
&lsquo;Til the boom or the bust of the economy.]]></description>

Putin&rsquo;s Forever War has created a fright,
The conflict in Ukraine&rsquo;s taking its flight.
South Africa lost to Sweden with a kick,
Kennedy&rsquo;s campaign leaving a mix.
Facial recognition false, eight months pregnant arrested, it&rsquo;s not right!]]></description>
