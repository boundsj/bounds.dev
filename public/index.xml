There once was a task to be done,
With headlines and links, not one.
But with nothing to read,
No limerick to breed,
This task was no limerick fun.
 These are the headlines that were used to create this post:]]></description>

There once was an empty collection,
Devoid of all news and direction.
No stories to tell,
Or links to dispel,
The void mismatched all detection.

There once was an error quite strict,
Which said headlines were something it missed.
So it couldnâ€™t proceed,
To fulfill the limerick need,
Leaving patterns of rhyme to persist.

There once was a task to entreat,
But no headlines to dance to the beat.
With nothing to read,
No news could proceed,
And thus the task faced its defeat.

There once was a script meant to process,
But the input it got was just hopeless.
No headlines, no links,
Just an empty data sink,
In a sea of information, it&rsquo;s focusless.

There once was a task to be done,
With headlines and links, but there&rsquo;s none.
I searched high and low,
But alas, nothing to show,
And so the limerick cannot be spun.

There once was a challenge quite tricky,
With no headlines to make the verse sticky.
So I sat there in thought,
My muse I sought,
But alas, the content was picky.

There once was a task quite cryptic,
With headlines that seemed quite mystic.
But the data was shy,
Or perhaps it did fly,
And now the response is simplistic.

There once was a task to create,
A limerick with headlines, a mandate.
But no news was supplied,
Though I searched far and wide,
So this verse is the twist of our fate.
