Ukraine's troops set out from a hub,  
Their mission to Bakhmut, talons a-rub.  
Turkey and Finland,  
Their alliance to mend,  
While Mexico mourns a horrific fire and dub.  
  
Guo Wengui, to fraud and crime linked,  
His fortune? now greatly diminished.  
Immigrants rushed in,  
As US populations thin,  
And a teenager's online grudges pointed the blame stick.  
  
The Tokyo scandals invoke old Sapporo,  
Biden, the GOP, and their little ado.  
For Panama a visit,  
And a melon dehiscent,  
Oh, and then there's the old ballgame, too!  
  
Bolsonaro's spin starts anew,  
DeSantis, Trump, and the internet, too.  
Put down your guns,  
Stories of young lives undone,  
And the Taliban's food choices -- le bleurgh!
