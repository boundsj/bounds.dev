Pressured their base on abortion, the Republicans strain,  
Though most wished to display no disdain.  
Supreme Court justices,  
Their ruling may miss us,  
While South Korea's enraged by the gain.  
  
Leaked Pentagon papers aplenty,  
Spying accusations they sent to the penny.  
Ukraine's war won by lights,  
To EV goals new heights,  
And children separated, could any be more shabby?  
  
Sex abuse in Mississippi with the sheriff untouchable,  
Mrs. Maisel did a final curtsy, that was acceptable.  
China's youth seek manual labor,  
To Ukraine's prime minister, Canada gave a neighbor.  
  
Can intelligence be apart from the body?  
Reinstated to the House, a Democratic lawmaker rightly.  
Seeing wildflowers in California, Arizona and more,  
Adam Westbrook, Emily Holzknecht, and many more.
