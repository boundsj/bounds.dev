Ukraine's top commander soon did show,  
His plan was a mighty offensive blow.  
Putin stayed out of sight,  
Both sides put up a fight,  
To end the war they sought to know.  
Midnight calls and marathon meetings,  
Where hopes of an end, were fleeting.  
Yellen warned of debt,  
but her pleas were not met,  
Leaving her to face the fallout, she's receiving.
