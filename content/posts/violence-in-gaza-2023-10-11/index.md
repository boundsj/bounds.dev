Village by village, scale of atrocities clear,  
Airstrikes pummel Gaza, Israelis and Palestinians near,  
Israel's security services failed to stop the attack,  
Iran news said no direct involvement, which they lacked,  
In tiny, crowded Gaza, violent videos fill social feed,  
Shockingly, Israel braces for invasion, indeed.
