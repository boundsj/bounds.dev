Donald Trump called for protest,  It gave rise to commotion and unrest.  In Manhattan they would come,  For justice to be done.  From the East 'round to the West Coast.    China's ties with Russia they deepened,  Their peacemaking claims were then weakened.  So the Judge issued a warrant,  Putin's defiantly went;  To Mariupol, off he had steppen.    Americans sought a life better,  In Europe they went to get sweeter;  With the Euro Exchange rate,  A good life they could make;  In Europe was something much better.     The Iraq War, Iran was the victor,  A decade of havoc, it yielded disaster;  In photos we can see,  The aftermath of what be,  A country's life in disorder.     Covid has thrown a Florida hospital in shock,  Politics leaves the poor in a thick fog;  For the sake of their health,  It's best to just keep the wealth,  In politics, money is the talk.
