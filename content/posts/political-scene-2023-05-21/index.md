In the political sphere,  
Biden promised to help out Ukraine.  
Zelensky denied, Bakhmut is not defied,  
But F-16s could help them now see.  
Sanctions Trump had given,  
Minerals aplenty driven,  
G7 hopes to escape China's domination.  
Emanuel pushed Japan far,  
Crossed through jungle, migrants are,  
Debt limit Biden claims time to spar.  
Scott focused on Black Republicans,  
Desantis skirting abortion ban,  
China's city of BBQ hit with tourists stampede.  
Greece's migrants blocking fence,  
Runners still using paper pins,  
Weekender now Martha graces Sports Illustrated cover.
