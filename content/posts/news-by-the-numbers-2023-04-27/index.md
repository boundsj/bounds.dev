Economy's power ebbed and flowed,  
As interest rates did its toll hold.  
Inflation so high,  
What's driving it? Why,  
A different set of drivers we're told.  
Fox's top execs, in a bind,  
When a crisis, texts, came to find.  
Airman accused,  
Racist and violent remarks used,  
These headlines are all intertwined.  
Sudan's capital, a sight to fear,  
As paramilitary forces, it clear.  
A.I. wants to write?  
Choose an author, then show how it's done right.  
Musk ramps up A.I., dangers to fear,  
Consulting firm a Chinese crackdown is near.  
Chinese bankers investigated for sure,  
And in Ukrainian kitchens, a symbol of loss, for sure.  
Wall Street Journal reporter's release is a must,  
As seven copyright cases, together we discuss.  
Karl and Anna, and their clothes,  
And the Met Gala, here is what goes.  
The N.F.L. draft, a new tone it needs,  
A cognition test, N.F.L. hopefuls, yes please.  
Korean dressing, Irish poetry, and 'American Pie',   
State dinner of harmony, stand tall and high.  
Philadelphia, 36 hours to explore,  
Tipping while traveling, what are the new laws?  
Boyfriend's other options, why pursue?  
We'll have to wait and see, it's true.
