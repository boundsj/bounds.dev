A man from Delaware with $1 million at home,  
Sought real estate to explore on his own.  
He chose Idaho and North Carolina too,  
And with a friend, went house-hunting, it's true.  
A NYC pad near Central Park made their dreams soar,  
With a price tag of $75 million, that's sure to astound the rich and the poor!
