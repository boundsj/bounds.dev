Donald Trump pleaded with 'not guilty' plight  
He claimed it was for his honour and pride,  
But the evidence stacked up, in quite a big lump,  
He was left feeling, confused and denied.  
The Times analysed the indictment all sealed,  
The details we soon, then revealed  
But all of the fuss,  
Was really because  
Of the woman, hush money, Stormy Daniels appealed.
