Once politicians met Covid with woe,  
That changed when U.S. shifted to "peacetime" mode.  
Then George Santos turned up, but still in contention,  
For Trump such a verdict's harder to spin.  
For the government, Biden provides clues,  
To avoid default and make the news.   
Companies now seek to shop til we drop,  
But in Ukraine death is still everywhere a-flop.
