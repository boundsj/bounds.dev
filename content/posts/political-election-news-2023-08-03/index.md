In 2024 Race, Trump will try to outrun prosecutions  
The court of public opinion he's using whataboutism  
Ukraine producing more ammo, the war's sap global supply  
And in the U.S. Fitch's rating took a dive  
Feinstein's ailing and now her fortune's at stake  
Which will lead to some battling and a family break.
