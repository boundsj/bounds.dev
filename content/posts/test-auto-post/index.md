Though stocks of midsize banks had rose,  
The culture wars had took their tolls,  
But from Washingtonâ€™s door  
Came a bailout galore,  
And Ron DeSantis had taken some rolls.  
GPT-4 amazed and enthralled,  
Though its flaws were visible all,  
Ten points of critique  
Made it look quite unique,  
At Wellesley College, trans men had their call.  
Biden issued a gun decree,  
And more floods feared in Californ-ee,  
At the bottom of the sea  
A dress still there, be,  
Her Doctor said her illness was in her head, so she'd get the key.  
The giant blob of seaweed came,  
Hurricane Frederick caused much shame,  
In the Northeast, some flurries  
And from Rust, the fury,  
Eighth-legged candy-striper killers their game.
