We've seen a lot of intense winter storms in San Francisco this year. The rain has kept the ground soft and the heavy wind has taken down a lot of trees. In McLaren Park, several of the trees have fallen over the [Philosopher's Way trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Way,_San_Francisco).
