In Gaza's heart a crisis brewed, and power was the feud,  
A mayor's end, a city's quest, in Alabama's vested breast,  
The hikers trusted maps in vain, on trails that don't exist by name,  
In Texas, shrimpers of Vietnam, seek new paths to remain calm,  
While Gaza's hospital's plight and power cries into the night.
