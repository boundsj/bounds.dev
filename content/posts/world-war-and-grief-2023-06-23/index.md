Ukraine's fighters are primed for a fight,  
China sends gunpowder with might.  
Kakhovka saw a strike,  
A year without Roe,  
Where the clinics close one does not write.  
Secret Navy sensors detected a heat,  
The Titan that went to its defeat.  
James Cameron knew the flaw,  
To Charleston for a journey of woe,  
Far Right spins its tale to the street.  
Superconductor claims in a cool room,  
Heat wave ravages Texas in doom.  
Trump does not stay quiet,  
Gender names in polite society,  
My husband's bones I must exhume.  
Victor Wembanyama, a star,  
Ezra Klein's show and the Boreal bar.  
Maya Jasanoff wrote,  
David French to the court,  
McWhorter's thoughts from afar.  
Pride anthems we must play,  
For no price can be set on that day.  
Colby owns the runway,  
Kansas wishes to abortion's delay,  
Y.A. books and letters to sway.
