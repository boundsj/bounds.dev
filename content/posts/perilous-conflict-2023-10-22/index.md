Concerns Rise That Israel-Hamas conflict will widen,  
A struggle engulfed in a storm that will darken.  
Qatar aided the US, to free two Americans with glee  
But three weapons are needed by Israel and Ukraine to be free.  
Bridge builders between sides, felt an opportunity shine,  
But will it be enough with the conflict so entwined?
