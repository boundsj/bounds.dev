*Generated by `gpt-4-1106-preview` from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4) with headlines the front page of the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) with a category of `error`*

But the page was quite blank, and not bold.  
No words there to rhyme,  
Nor reason, nor time,  
Just silence, undisturbed and cold.
