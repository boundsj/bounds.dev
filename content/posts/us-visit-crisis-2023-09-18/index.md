In U.S. Visit, Zelensky to make his plea  
Say thank you and hope for more aid from the sea  
The ministers departed, so much cause to grieve  
But will it be enough for the country to achieve?  
The crisis of migrants still rampant and strong  
Will the people have faith it won't last very long?  
Events of the day could seem quite confusin'  
But the people should trust in their leaders resusin'.
