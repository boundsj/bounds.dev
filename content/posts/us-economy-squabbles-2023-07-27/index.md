An economy from the US did grow,  
But then it had some unions to show.  
The ECB also raised  
'Cause inflation braised;  
Putin sweetened the pot with some grain, though.  
  
Kyiv's advance got a wall,  
And Oligarchs had million-dollar stalls.  
Elite colleges saw  
A legacy boost, a flaw;  
The US meanwhile had a flash of brilliance sure to maul.  
  
Australia's loss to Nigeria  
Gave Portugal a much-needed win, we see.  
Supreme Court pay skyrockets,  
ChatGPT's security pockets,  
Leading to exploited migrants, distressingly.  
  
Mitch McConnell had a freeze  
As Sinead Oâ€™Connor made the Pope squeeze.  
A Springboard in sight,  
China erasing a plight -  
American giants see Israel as the keys.
