Erdogan's election in Turkey  
Will stir western relief and cause Moscow anxiety.  
Conversations about asylum  
Make for a complicated congressional task.  
Anxiety and relief in migrant camps,  
It was worth it when they reach our land's ramps.  
With dreams of a better life  
They survive danger and strife,  
It's a daily game of Russian roulette in these camps.
