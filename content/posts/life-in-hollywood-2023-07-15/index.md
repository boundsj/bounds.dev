In Hollywood, the strikes are such a pain,  
But Los Angeles still feels its strain.  
The Gilgo Beach killings,  
Escorts and their feelings,  
Can't compare to the Titan's life bane.  
A.I. startup scared of what it does,  
Be it recipes, plans, or making a buzz.  
But from floods and heat waves,  
To Siberia's caves,  
It's clear that A.I. can't invent, just because.
