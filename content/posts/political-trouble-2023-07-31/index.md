Trump's crushing DeSantis and GOP foes,  
Caused Ron to suggest more attacks that'd go low.  
Missiles that strike,  
Spending that's tight,  
All cause global political woes.  
Heard 'round the world, Ukraine's pleas,  
Saudi Arabia might aid, if you please.  
Phoenix's hellish month of heat,  
Economy's hit with a defeat.  
The Soccer Moms, whose game has changed,  
FIFA thought the Women's Cup re-arranged.  
Vlatko tuning out the noise,  
FBI found a mysterious spy toy's cost.  
Netanyahu court remake of sorts,  
Minor characters to play main parts.  
California's homeless get no reprieve,  
True-crime known more from non-glorification.  
Era of the Top Gun C.E.O.,  
A happier work life is what we should know.
