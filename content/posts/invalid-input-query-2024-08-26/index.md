*Generated by `gpt-4-1106-preview` from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4) with headlines the front page of the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) with a category of `error`*

A request was made, but alas, no headlines in sight,  
Impossible to rhyme, or to write with delight.  
No links to inspire verse,  
Left the poet with a curse,  
And the limerick couldn't take flight.
