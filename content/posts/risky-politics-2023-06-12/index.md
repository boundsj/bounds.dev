Fear, mayhem and defiance there's no mistaking,  
The war in Ukraine keeps on escalating.  
NATO takes a stand with bold drills so stark,  
But Trump's indicted with evidence from his own lawyer's mark.  
Berlusconi's gone, the Italian showman demise,  
Noise may take years off your life, a surprise.  
When a former toxic waste site's found,  
No one around will answer the sound.  
Senegal's in uproar with death of a brother,  
While US electric grid needs the green push to smother.  
JPMorgan's Epstein victims get settlement due,  
But Tony awards 'Kimberly Akimbo' the play view.  
Denver's Nuggets could make history once more,  
These wheel's can take you around the beach shore.  
Father's Day gifts, and nature's Ozempic,  
Our writers on Trump, and a soccer trick.  
Battle for supremacy, and US rejoining UNESCO,  
A federal agency seeks a boss who will show.   
Domestic abuse orders need the right to bear arms,  
Father's day pinball arcade, and our writer's alarms.  
Ending slavery, and a song of favorite pick,  
These books, Djokovic, and a surprise football kick.  
Nuggets have proved they are the N.B.A.'s best,  
McGregor sends Miami's mascot to the E.R. to rest.
