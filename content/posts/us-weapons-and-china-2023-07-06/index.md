The U.S. is deconstructing its weapons fast,  
While China and Germany, attempt to outlast.  
NATO's hopes for Sweden, now on the backburner,  
Since Hungary and Turkey, their membership do spurner.  
Yellen now travels to China with caution,  
Though business models wobble, there's come a distortion.
