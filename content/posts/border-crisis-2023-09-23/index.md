One Day on the Border, Eight Thousand Nine Hundred,  
As More Migrants Were Arrested, Left Feeling Forsaken.  
The Far Right's Alliance Brought Washington to its Knees,  
Their Wrecking Ball Polices Were Enough to Displease.  
Ukraine Took a Big Challenge, Pledging Ammunitions In Store,  
But Providing It, Was A Problem It Couldn't Ignore.
